            <p>Don’t look anywhere else if you need a Shuttle Service or Airport Transfer in the Dominican Republic – after 16 years serving the transportation needs of tens of thousands of customers we definitely know what your best options are</p>
            <p>And …. don’t be fooled by all these fancy websites out there …. about transfer options in the Dominican Republic …. most of them are made by persons who don’t even live here and only know very little or nothing about your real transportation options, distances, new roads and highways, regular flights and possible combinations and connections in Dominican Republic.</p>
            <p>Take your time before you book and chat with us. We know what your best transportation options are and we analyze them in less then a minute when you let us know your travel details. We can even be helpful if you need information about the different destinations in the Dominican Republic. If our live chat is not available, simply send us a mail with your travel details and we will contact you within 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Whether you have to go from SDQ (Las Americas airport) to your hotel in Santo Domingo City or from SDQ to Punta Cana, Samana, Cabarete or Puerto Plata or from Punta Cana to Samana or Puerto Plata, have a look at our Private Shuttle Service in Kia Sportage and check out our Regular Flights or combined Flight &amp; Shuttle options for your next trip.</p>
            <p>On our Airport Transfers &amp; Shuttle Service or Regular Flights and Flight &amp; Shuttle options page you will find everything you need – a map where you can see the actual route, the fares and you’ll be only one click away from booking your Private Shuttle Service in Kia Sportage, or your Regular Flight or combined Flight &amp; Shuttle option for your next vacation or business trip to the Dominican Republic.</p>
            <p>Roads and connections between cities in the Dominican Republic have improved considerably. There is a new highway from Santo Domingo to Samana which shortens the distance by road from 5 hours to only 2 hours 15 min. Also the road from Santo Domingo to Punta Cana improved. Santo Domingo to Punta Cana is not a 3 hours + drive anymore but merely a 2 hours 30 min drive. If you have to go from SDQ (Las Americas airport) to Cabarete, Sosua or Puerto Plata we use the new highway and go first towards Samana and then continue on a pretty good fixed road with only few traffic to the North Coast.</p>
            <p>Trips from Punta Cana to Samana or from Punta Cana to Puerto Plata by car are still quite long. We offer regular flights between Punta Cana and the Samana area, and private charter flights between Punta Cana and the Puerto Plata and Sosua area as there are currently no regular flights. For any questions or information on your options for traveling anywhere in the Dominican Republic please use our Chat or send us an email.</p>
